# Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development.

## History
Bootstrap, originally named Twitter Blueprint, was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at  [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter")  as a framework to encourage consistency across internal tools. Before Bootstrap, various libraries were used for interface development, which led to inconsistencies and a high maintenance burden. According to  Twitter developer Mark Otto:

> A super small group of developers and I got together to design and build a new internal tool and saw an opportunity to do something more. Through that process, we saw ourselves build something much more substantial than another internal tool. Months later, we ended up with an early version of Bootstrap as a way to document and share common design patterns and assets within the company.
